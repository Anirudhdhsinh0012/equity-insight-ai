# Export & Reports Functionality

## Overview

The Export & Reports functionality has been successfully implemented to provide CSV and PDF downloads of historical quota usage data. This feature is designed for audits, billing reconciliation, and usage analysis.

## Features Implemented

- **Export Options**: CSV and PDF formats for 7-day and 30-day periods
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during export operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user notifications

### ðŸ”¹ Backend API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/finnhub/export`
- **Formats**: CSV and PDF support
- **Time Periods**: Configurable days (1-365)
- **Data Generation**: Mock historical data for demonstration

### ðŸ”¹ Report Types

#### CSV Reports
- Historical quota usage data
- Daily breakdowns with timestamps
- Usage percentages and limits
- Service information
- Perfect for Excel analysis

#### PDF Reports
- Professional formatted reports
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Visual usage trends and insights
- Detailed daily breakdown table
- Ready for audits and presentations

## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ApiQuotaBanner.tsx          # Enhanced with export functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/finnhub/export/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ route.ts                # Export API endpoint
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ export-test/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ page.tsx                # Test page for export functionality
â””â”€â”€ services/
    â””â”€â”€ pdfReportService.ts         # PDF generation service
```

## Usage

### Frontend Usage
```tsx
import ApiQuotaBanner from '@/components/ApiQuotaBanner';

// Show banner with export functionality
<ApiQuotaBanner showAlways={true} />
```

### API Usage
```javascript
// CSV Export
GET /api/finnhub/export?format=csv&days=30

// PDF Export  
GET /api/finnhub/export?format=pdf&days=7
```

## Export Options

1. **CSV - Last 7 days**: Quick overview for recent analysis
2. **CSV - Last 30 days**: Monthly usage patterns and trends
3. **PDF - Last 7 days**: Professional weekly report
4. **PDF - Last 30 days**: Comprehensive monthly analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Export Process
1. User clicks export button in `ApiQuotaBanner`
2. Dropdown menu shows available export options
3. Selection triggers API call to `/api/finnhub/export`
4. Server generates report and returns file
5. Browser downloads file automatically

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface QuotaHistoryRecord {
  timestamp: string;
  quotaUsed: number;
  quotaLimit: number;
  quotaRemaining: number;
  isLimitReached: boolean;
  apiCalls: number;
  service: string;
}
```

### PDF Features
- Professional styling with Inter font
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Usage trend analysis
- Visual progress bars
- Color-coded status indicators
- Print-optimized layout

## Testing

Visit `/export-test` page to test the export functionality:
- http://localhost:3001/export-test

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Integration**: Replace mock data with real historical data
2. **PDF Library**: Integrate puppeteer or similar for true PDF generation
3. **Email Reports**: Schedule and email reports automatically
4. **Custom Date Ranges**: Allow users to select custom date ranges
5. **Multi-Service Reports**: Include other API services beyond Finnhub
6. **Chart Integration**: Add usage charts and graphs to reports

## Security Considerations

- Export functionality requires proper authentication
- Sensitive data should be sanitized in reports
- Rate limiting should be applied to export endpoints
- File size limits should be enforced

## Performance Notes

- Large date ranges may impact performance
- Consider implementing pagination for very large datasets
- Cache frequently requested reports
- Use background jobs for complex report generation

## Complexity Assessment

**Implemented Complexity**: Low-Medium âœ…
- Frontend UI: Simple dropdown with loading states
- Backend API: Straightforward report generation
- PDF Generation: HTML-based with professional styling
- Mock Data: Realistic historical data simulation

This implementation provides a solid foundation that can be enhanced with additional features as needed.
